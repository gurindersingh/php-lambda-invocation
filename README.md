# PHP Lambda Invocation

__NOTE: A recent API Gateway update has improved the usage of Lambda functions from a web context considerably. Therefore this code is no longer maintained. We recommend switching to API Gateway to invoke Lambda functions from a web context.__

A small PHP script that invokes Lambda functions.

PHP Lambda Invocation implements the [HTTP Function Protocol](HTTP-FUNCTION-PROTOCOL-0.8.md).
